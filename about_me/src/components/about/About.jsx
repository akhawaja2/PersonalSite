        <p>
            The name's Abu Khawaja. I was both in North New Jersey and always loved computers growing up. 
            I got my B.S. in Computer Science from Ramapo College and from there got going,
            working as a software developer for numerous companies across the east coast. 
            These days I do that and a bunch more - dipping my toes in entrepreneurship, coaching fighters,
            and experiencing life to the fullest.
